PROJECT REPORT: Analyzing Customer Churn and Business Recovery Strategies

Customer churn isn’t just a business metric—it’s an early signal of brand disconnection and market failure. Using Power BI, I analyzed transaction and behavior patterns from a dataset sourced on Kaggle, focusing on delivery performance, user types, and regional activity. A significant drop in transaction volume—especially among first-time users—and the complete loss of the Seattle market pointed to critical issues in onboarding, retention strategy, and experience design.

Aim:  
To investigate the root causes of customer churn and evaluate patterns that inform future retention and reactivation strategies.

Objectives:  
✅ Identify high-churn customer segments and behavioral trends  
✅ Evaluate the impact of delivery performance on customer retention  
✅ Propose data-driven retention and re-entry strategies

3. Research Questions  
✅ What customer segments are most affected by churn (e.g., first-time, guest, and returning users)?  
✅ How has delivery performance influenced customer trust and activity?  
✅ What proactive steps can improve retention and rebuild market presence?

Data Collection:  
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and prepared for analysis in Power BI.

Data Analysis:  
Using Power BI’s visualization tools, I created interactive dashboards to explore relationships between customer behavior, delivery success, regional shifts, and product trends.

5. Findings & Insights
I worked on a customer analysis project for an e-commerce business. Initially, I reduced the dataset from 50,000 to 10,000 rows to make the analysis manageable. However, I soon realized this compromised data reliability—my findings on customer loss and sales trends lacked depth and accuracy.  

I went back, reloaded the full dataset, and restarted the analysis in Power BI. A customer-over-time chart quickly showed a significant drop in customers after November, particularly in December and January.  

Guided by feedback, I shifted focus entirely to customer behavior, exploring potential causes. I introduced slicers for delivery type,  and charts for transaction result, and device type. This deeper analysis revealed that:  

Normal delivery, though more popular, had more failed transactions and was slower, discouraging new or returning customers. Normal delivery showed a 16% failure rate compared to 11% for one-day delivery—highlighting a potential trust and reliability gap  

January saw a steep drop across all top-selling products, suggesting seasonal disengagement and possibly unmet customer expectations.
  
Churn Concentration in Key Segments:  
Guest and first-time users showed the highest churn rates, indicating onboarding inefficiencies and missed conversion moments.  Mobile users faced more issues than web users, hinting at poor user experience on the mobile platform and web was not much better.

Seattle Market Disengagement:  
Customers drop from 12421 in November to 0 by January. The majority of Seattle users accessed the platform via web, and their activity dropped sharply post-December.  



6. Recommendations  
✅ Onboarding Optimization:  
Introduce guided tutorials, personalized greetings, and welcome offers for first-time users.  

✅ Loyalty Program Revamp:  
Incentivize long-term engagement with tiered rewards, referral bonuses, and exclusive discounts.  

✅ Seattle Market Relaunch:  
Tailor a re-entry strategy based on hyper-local promotions, partnerships, and eco-conscious offerings.  
✅ Boost Delivery Speed and Safety Standards: Partner with logistics teams to reduce delivery time and failure rates—rebuilding trust through transparent tracking and consistent service.
✅ UI/UX Overhaul: Conduct usability audits and optimize login flows, responsiveness, and accessibility for a frictionless experience on all devices


7. Conclusion  
This project highlights how delivery inefficiencies, weak user onboarding, and misaligned regional strategies contribute to customer churn. While the loss of the Seattle market was substantial. Stronger personalization, , and localized marketing will be vital for customer retention going forward. Customer churn isn’t just about lost transactions—it reflects lost relationships. From delivery breakdowns to web interface friction, every aspect of the experience shapes retention. This project provides a clear map for recovery: optimize delivery operations, refine digital usability, and re-establish regional relevance. With data-backed decisions and user-centered design, retention becomes more than a goal—it becomes a growth engine
